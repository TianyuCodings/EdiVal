################# generate backgrounds ####################


Please generate 30 realistic and visually distinctive background scenarios for use with an image generation model. Each background should be:

Clearly described using concise, concrete language that is easy for a language model to understand and interpret.

Visually varied, covering a wide range of environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor, natural, man-made, etc.).

Realistic only â€” no fantasy, surreal, or imaginary elements.

Free from specific location or city names (e.g., avoid "Paris street", "European city view", or similar).

The goal is to create prompts that lead to easily recognizable, well-defined backgrounds that image generation models can reproduce consistently and language models can describe or detect reliably.
